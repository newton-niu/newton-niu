Hi, I'm Newton.

I'm interested in brain-inspired computing, machine learning, deep learning, neuroscience,
and building research-driven systems and products.

Selected Projects:
- easycml – neuromorphic learning and cognitive map modeling
- ToneFinder – multi-rate audio visualization and DSP tools
